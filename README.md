## Project Title: 
Historical Holiday Weather

## Team Codename: 
The 8 Team

## Team Members: 
Susan Beno, Euan Pedley, Leo Ronan

## User Story:  
As an event planner, I want to have an idea of what weather patterns might be like on a certain date so that I can generalize what type of weather to plan for. When I choose a date, I want to know what the weather has been for the past 5 years for my location. I would like to see a seasonal image to match the date that I am searching to make my research more enjoyable.

## Project Descriptions
* On opening the page, user is presented with a search input box for their location and the date of their choosing. 
* Foundation was used as our CSS framework. 
* On entering a date and city, weather results from the past 5 years are returned using Meta Weather API. 
* GIPHY API was used to add a seasonal image to the results page, to create a more enjoyable user experience.
